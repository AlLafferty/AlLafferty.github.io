<h2>
  Excerpt from Faith Healing (1960. The Whitsun Weddings)
</h2>
<p>
  By now, allâ€™s wrong. In everyone there sleeps
</p>   
<p>
  A sense of life lived according to love
</p>
<p>
  To some it means the difference they could make
</p>
 <p>
   By loving others, but across most it sweeps
</p>  
<p>
  As all they might have done had they been loved. 
</p>
<p>
  That nothing cures. 
</p>
  
<h2>Ugly Sister (1944. The North Ship)</h2>
<p>I will climb thirty steps to my room,</p>
<p>Lie on my bed;</p>
<p>Let the music, the violin, cornet and drum</p>
<p>Drowse from my head.</p>
<p>Since I was not bewitched in adolescence</p>
<p>And brought to love,</p>
<p>I will attend to the trees and their gracious silence,</p>
<p>To winds that move.</p>
